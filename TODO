Outstanding:


Calculate weapon/spell damage

the backstory generator needs to be totally reworked
if a character has a shield they shouldn't have a twohanded weapon in their other hand

abilities,subrace and racial traits are arrays, change to object and check druid abilities, i think they may be wrong
place racial_traits under subrace

add bloodline to Sorcerer class (SRD only provides draconic)
need to review all first level class features
implement fighter fighting styles
SRD clerics can wear heavy armor due to their domain
actually the whole cleric domain stuff needs to be properly modelled
rogue expertise needs to apply
apply Sorcerer Draconic Bloodline stuff : https://www.5esrd.com/classes/sorcerer/sorcerous-origins/draconic-bloodline/
warlock patrons
assignspells should set non caster spells as well

Done:

I think one of the subrace bonuses is adding a null CON value?
update variable names to lowercase/camelCase format
Change the character abilities to objects with the ability description included (or use an API? http://www.dnd5eapi.co/)
Skills really need to be encapsulated in an object (housekeeping)
